I am currently a graduate student at the Chow Institute for Economic Research, Xiamen University, specializing in quantitative economics. I received my bachelor’s degree from Southeast University, where I spent my two years in the School of Automation before transferring to the School of Economics and Management for the remaining two years.

My primary research interests include household and firm heterogeneity, monetary and fiscal policy, and numerical methods, with a particular focus on applying deep learning techniques to solve high dimension macroeconomic models. I also have interests in the use of text as data. 

From June to August 2025, I served as a research assistant to Prof. [Ji Huang](https://jihuang.weebly.com/) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). I am currently advised by Prof. [Xiangyu Feng](https://faculty.xmu.edu.cn/FXY/zh_CN/index/594493/list/index.htm).

In my spare time, I enjoy playing football and middle- to long-distance running. I have completed a half marathon . I am also interested in competitive programming contests.

[News] After overcoming an iliotibial band (IT band) injury, I finally reached 2,000 km on September 23, 2025.
