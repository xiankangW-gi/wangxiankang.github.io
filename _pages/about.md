I am currently a graduate student at the Chow Institute for Economic Research, Xiamen University, specializing in quantitative economics. I received my bachelor’s degree from Southeast University, where I spent my first year in the School of Automation before transferring to the School of Economics and Management for the remaining three years.

My primary research interests include household heterogeneity, monetary and fiscal policy, and numerical methods, with a particular focus on applying deep learning techniques to solve complex macroeconomic models.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing football and middle- to long-distance running. I have completed a half marathon and, as of September 4, 2025, I have run a total of 1,960 kilometers. I am also interested in competitive programming contests.
